# Project Description:

A Ticket Vending Machine (TVM), also known as a ticket machine or a ticketing kiosk,
is an automated, self-service, vending machine that produces tickets for some means of
public transportation. (There are TVMs for other purposes, but the attention here is on
public transportation only.) 

The purpose of the project is to create a set of interrelated artifacts for the problem as
well as the solution domain of the software aspect of a maintainable, secure,
(environmentally) sustainable, and usable TVM. In the rest of the document, ‘iGo’ stands
for the name of both the project and the product, unless otherwise stated. 

iGo is an object-oriented software engineering project, involving certain elements of
both agile methodologies and rigid methodologies. It involves individual work as well
as communal work.
